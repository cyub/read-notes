# 50个让生活更美好的建议

## Happiness 幸福

1. You don’t have to love your job. Jobs are a way to make money. Many people live fine lives in okay jobs by using the money they make on things they care about.
    
    你不必热爱你的工作。工作是赚钱的一种方式。许多人通过将赚到的钱花在自己关心的事情上，从事着不错的工作，过着美好的生活。
    
2. Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking! 
    
    斯特金定律指出，90% 的事物都是垃圾。如果你不喜欢诗歌、艺术或其他东西，可能是你只见过垃圾。去找好的！
    
3. People don’t realize how much they hate commuting. A nice house farther from work is not worth the fraction of your life you are giving to boredom and fatigue. 
    
    人们没意识到通勤多让人讨厌。离工作远的漂亮房子不值得你花在无聊和疲劳上的时间。
    
4. There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out. 
    
    有证据表明，内向者和外向者都能从变得更外向中受益。下次不确定要不要出门时，考虑这一点。


## Success 成功

5. History remembers those who got to market first. Getting your creation out into the world is more important than getting it perfect. 
    
    历史记住的是第一个进入市场的人。把你的创作推向世界比追求完美更重要。
    
6. Are you on the fence about breaking up or leaving your job? You should probably go ahead and do it. People, on average, end up happier when they take the plunge. 
    
    你是否在分手或离职方面犹豫不决？你或许应该继续去做。平均而言，人们在采取行动后会更快乐。
    
7. Done is better than perfect.
    
    完成胜于完美。
    
8. Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.
    
    纪律优于激励。前者是可以训练的，后者是转瞬即逝的。如果你只依靠动力，你将无法完成伟大的事情。
    
9. You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.
    
    通过练习提高你的沟通技巧比通过练习提高你的智力更有效。如果你不那么聪明但能清晰表达想法，你比那些表达不清的人有很大优势。
    
10. You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
    
    你不是活在电子游戏里。如果你要做傻事或长期走错方向，没有弹窗警告。你得自己创造警告。
    
11. If you listen to successful people talk about their methods, remember that all the people who used the same methods and failed did not make videos about it.
    
    听成功人士讲述他们的方法时，记住：用同样方法但失败的人不会拍视频宣传。
    
12. The best advice is personal and comes from somebody who knows you well. Take broad-spectrum advice like this as needed, but the best way to get help is to ask honest friends who love you.
    
    最好的建议是针对个人的，来自了解你的人。像这样的泛泛建议按需取用，但寻求帮助的最好方式是问那些爱你的诚实朋友。
    
13. Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to.
    
    让做事尽可能简单。找到最简单的开始锻炼方式，找到最简单的开始写作方式。人们往往把事情弄得太复杂，导致失败后沮丧。尽量避免。
    
14. Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.
    
    培养可靠的声誉。好的声誉很珍贵，因为它容易被毁且难以重建。你不必煮出最棒的咖啡，只要顾客知道咖啡总是热的就好。
    
15. How you spend every day is how you spend your life. 
    
    你怎样度过每一天，你就怎样度过一生。

## Relationships 人际关系

16. In relationships look for somebody you can enjoy just hanging out near. Long-term relationships are mostly spent just chilling.
    
    在关系中，找一个你喜欢静静相处的人。长期关系大部分时间都在轻松共处中度过。
    
17. Don’t complain about your partner to coworkers or online. The benefits are negligible and the cost is destroying a bit of your soul.
    
    不要向同事或网上抱怨你的伴侣。好处微乎其微，代价是毁掉你的一部分灵魂。
    
18. After a breakup, cease all contact as soon as practical. The potential for drama is endless, and the potential for a good friendship is negligible. Wait a year before trying to be friends again.
    
    分手后，尽快停止所有联系。制造戏剧的可能性无穷，保持好友谊的可能性微乎其微。等一年后再尝试做朋友。
    
19. When dating, de-emphasizing your quirks will lead to 90% of people thinking you’re kind of alright. Emphasizing your quirks will lead to 10% of people thinking you’re fascinating and fun. Those are the people interested in dating you. Aim for them. 
    
    约会时，淡化你的怪癖，90%的人会觉得你还行。强调你的怪癖，10%的人会觉得你有趣又迷人。这些人是你想约会的目标。
    

20. There are two red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people: 1. The perpetually aggrieved ; 2. The angry.

	几乎所有危险人物都有两个危险信号需要避开： 1. 永远觉得自己被冤枉的人；  2. 易怒的人。

21. Those who generate anxiety in you and promise that they have the solution are grifters. See: politicians, marketers, new masculinity gurus, etc. Avoid these.
    
    那些让你焦虑并承诺有解决方案的人是骗子。比如：政客、营销人员、新男性主义大师等。避开他们。


## Body 身体

22. The 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes of screenwork, look at a spot 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This will reduce eye strain and is easy to remember (or program reminders for).
    
    20-20-20 法则：每 20 分钟的屏幕工作，注视 20 英尺外的一个地点 20 秒。这将减轻眼睛疲劳并且易于记住（或设置提醒）。
    
23. Exercise is the most important lifestyle intervention you can do. Even the bare minimum (15 minutes a week) has a huge impact. Start small. 
    
    锻炼是你能做的最重要的生活方式干预。即使每周只有15分钟，也会有巨大影响。从小处开始。
    
24. Phones have gotten heavier in the last decade and they’re actually pretty hard on your wrists! Use a computer when it’s an alternative or try to at least prop up your phone.
    
    在过去的十年里，手机变得越来越重，它们实际上对你的手腕来说非常困难！如果可以的话，请使用计算机，或者至少尝试支撑您的手机。


## Productivity 生产力

25. Learn keyboard shortcuts. They’re easy to learn and you’ll get tasks done faster and easier.

	学习键盘快捷键。它们很容易学习，你将更快、更轻松地完成任务。

26. Keep your desk and workspace bare. Treat every object as an imposition upon your attention, because it is. A workspace is not a place for storing things. It is a place for accomplishing things.

    保持你的桌面和工作区空旷。把每个物件都当作对你注意力的干扰，因为它确实是。工作区不是储存物品的地方，而是完成工作的地方。

27. Reward yourself after completing challenges, even badly.

	完成挑战后奖励自己，即使完成得不太好。

## Rationality 理性

28. Noticing biases in others is easy, noticing biases in yourself is hard. However, it has a much higher pay-off. 
    
    注意到别人的偏见很容易，注意到自己的偏见却很困难。但后者回报更高。
    
29. Explaining problems is good. Often in the process of laying out a problem, a solution will present itself. 
    
    解释问题是好事。在梳理问题的过程中，解决方案往往会自己浮现。
    
30. Selfish people should listen to advice to be more selfless, selfless people should listen to advice to be more selfish. This applies to many things. Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most. 

    自私的人应该听取更多无私的建议，无私的人应该听取更多自私的建议。这适用于许多事情。每当你收到建议时，也要考虑相反的建议。你可能会忽略你最需要的建议。

## Compassion 同理心

31. Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.
    
    想到父母就给他们打电话，爱朋友时告诉他们。
    
32. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.
    
    多赞美别人。很多人不觉得自己聪明、漂亮或善良，除非有人告诉他们。你可以帮助他们。
    
33. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.
    
    不要因为别人尝试而惩罚他们。你会让他们不再尝试。惩罚包括抱怨他们花太久时间、做得不好或别人做得更好。
    
34. Don't punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve. 
    
    不要惩罚承认错误的人，这样会让他们更难进步。

35. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these.

	一般来说，你会找理由不对人友善。抵制这些。

## Possessions 财富

36. Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd, office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in.
    
	你一生中很大一部分时间使用的东西（床：1/3，办公椅：1/4）值得投资。

37. “Where is the good knife?” If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad Xs. Throw those out.

	“好刀在哪里？”如果你在找“好”的某样东西，说明你有不好的同类物品。把那些不好的扔掉。

38. If your work is done on a computer, get a second monitor. Less time navigating between windows means more time for thinking.

	如果你的工作是在电脑上完成的，那就买第二台显示器。减少在窗口间切换的时间，意味着有更多时间思考。

39. Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are established, junk will probably cease to be a problem. This is because any rule would be superior to our implicit rules (“keep this broken stereo for five years in case I learn how to fix it”).
    
    建立明确的规则来决定何时扔掉旧垃圾。一旦有了清晰的规则，垃圾问题可能就不再是问题。因为任何规则都比我们默认的“保留这个坏掉的音响五年，以防我学会修它”要好。
    
40. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.
    
    买东西时，时间和金钱是可以互换的。如果你缺钱，请花更多时间寻找优惠。如果您时间不够，请停止寻找超值优惠，只需在网上快速购买即可。

## Self 自我

41. Deficiencies do not make you special. The older you get, the more your inability to cook will be a red flag for people.

	缺陷并不会让你变得特别。你年纪越大，你不会做饭对人们来说就越是一个危险信号。

42. If you’re under 90, try things.

	如果你还不到 90 岁，就尝试一些事情。

43. Things that aren’t your fault can still be your responsibility. 
    
    那些不是你的错的事情，仍然可能是你的责任。
    
44. Defining yourself by your suffering is an effective way to keep suffering forever (ex. incels, trauma). 
    
    通过痛苦来定义自己是永远承受痛苦的有效方法（例如非自愿者、创伤）。
    
45. Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.
    
    保持小的身份认同。 “我不是那种做这种事的人”不是解释，而是陷阱。它阻止书呆子锻炼和男人跳舞。
    
46. Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’.
    
    别混淆“因为喜欢做某事”和“因为想被看作那种做某事的人”。
    
47. Remember that you are dying. 
    
    记住你终将死亡。
    
48. Personal epiphanies feel great, but they fade within weeks. Upon having an epiphany, make a plan and start actually changing behavior. 
    
    个人的顿悟感觉很棒，顿悟后，制定计划并开始改变行为。
    

## Others 其他的

49. In choosing between living with 0-1 people vs 2 or more people, remember that ascertaining responsibility will no longer be instantaneous with more than one roommate (“whose dishes are these?”).
    
    在与 0-1 人同住还是与 2 人或更多人同住之间进行选择时，请记住，与超过一名室友一起居住时将不再能够立即确定责任（“这些是谁的菜？”）。
    
50. When you ask people, “What’s your favorite book / movie / band?” and they stumble, ask them instead what book / movie / band they’re currently enjoying most. They’ll almost always have one and be able to talk about it.
    
    当你问别人“最喜欢的书/电影/乐队是什么？”他们支吾时，改问他们目前最享受的书/电影/乐队。他们几乎总有答案，也能聊得下去。
